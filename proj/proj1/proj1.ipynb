If we try to find edges on an image with noise, we will falsely think the noisy pixels in the image are edges.

    "We will implement a simple blur that works as follows: replace each pixel's intensity with the average of a 3x3 patch of pixels centered at the pixel. Here's an example with the original image on the left and the resulting pixel on the right.\n",

    "![](blurring.png)\n",

For this exercise, we use a \"clipping\" policy: pretend that the edges of the image are extended by 1 pixel in every direction by simply reusing the previous values at the image edge. We implement this behavior for you so you don't have to handle it.)"

However, we can also think of an image as a *2-dimensional function* $ f(x, y) \\rightarrow [0, 1] $ that maps a coordinate $(x, y)$ to the corresponding pixel brightness between 0 and 1. If, for example, we plot the function as a surface, we get something that looks like:\n",
