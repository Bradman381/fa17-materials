    "# Homework 3: EDA of Bike Sharing\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "This homework has four goals: \n",
    "\n",
    "* to learn how to read plain text delimited data into pandas\n",
    "* to gain experience preparing data for analysis\n",
    "* to use EDA to learn about your data \n",
    "* to learn how to make informative plots\n",
    "\n",
    "This assignment includes both specific tasks to perform and open-ended questions to investigate. The open-ended questions ask you to think creatively and critically in how you plot the data and summarize information gleaned from these visualizations.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are 4 parts to this assignment: \n",
    "- data preparation\n",
    "- exploring the distribution of riders\n",
    "- exploring the relationship between time and rider counts\n",
    "- and exploring the relationship between weather and rider counts. \n",
    "\n",
    "The data preparation section gives you specific tasks to perform. Then in each of the next three sections, you are asked to create 2 plots. The first plot is described in some detail and the second plot is one of your choosing.\n",
    "\n",
    "Be sure to choose a plot that provides additional information about the distributions and relationships in the data. Remember that we are interested in how ride sharing works.  Therefore, plots that, for example examine the weather in DC *without reference to ride sharing are not interesting*.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Be sure that your plots have informative titles, axis labels, and legends.**"
