    "In this assignment, you will implement distributed least squares linear regression using Apache Spark. As with Lab09 we will be using a service called Databricks to develop and run code. Databricks simplifies the setup of Apache Spark and the cloud, and it provides limited free cloud computing. Outside the context of this assignment, you can always run Apache Spark code on your own computer or in the cloud without Databricks.\n"
