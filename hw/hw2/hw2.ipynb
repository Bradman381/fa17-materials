The scores and violation information have been made available by the San Francisco Department of Public Health, and we have made these data available to you via the DS 100 repository. The main goal for this assignment is to understand how restaurants are scored. We will walk through the various steps of exploratory data analysis to do this. To give you a sense of how we think about each discovery we make and what next steps it leads to we will provide comments and insights along the way.\n",
